# Java Questions

- `Static`:
'Static' in Java is a keyword that can be used with variables, methods, and nested classes. It means that the variable or method belongs to the class itself, rather than an instance of the class. Static members are accessed using the class name, not via an object.

- `Volatile``:
'Volatile' is used to declare a variable that can be accessed by multiple threads. It ensures that changes to the variable are visible to all threads and helps prevent issues related to thread caching.

- `Synchronize`:
Synchronization in Java is used to ensure that only one thread can access a particular block of code or method at a time. It helps prevent data corruption or race conditions when multiple threads are involved.

- `Serialize`:
Serialization is the process of converting an object into a byte stream, which can be easily stored in a file, transmitted over the network, or even restored to an object. This is useful for data persistence.

- `Inner Classes`:
Inner classes are classes defined within another class. They can be static (belonging to the outer class, not requiring an instance) or non-static (associated with an instance of the outer class). Inner classes are used to logically group classes and increase encapsulation.
